📖 Introduction

Welcome to ScratchVerse – the community-powered library where Scratch creators can showcase their games and animations outside of Scratch. Whether you’ve built a polished game, a fun animation, or just want to share your creative experiments, this is the place to put it all together and let others explore your work.

Submitting your project is simple: just fill out our Google Form with your developer name, a link to your project, and your email. After that, our quality control team will review your submission within 1–10 days. If your project meets our criteria, it will be published right here for everyone to enjoy!

🛠️ Instructions for Submitting

Go to the submission Google Form (linked above).

Enter your developer name, project link, and email.

Optionally, add a short description of your game/animation — this helps us showcase it better!

Wait for the review process (1–10 days).

If approved, your project will appear in ScratchVerse 🎉

✅ Quality Control Criteria

To make sure everything on the site is fun, fair, and worth showing off, your project must meet these rules:

Originality – The project must be your own work (no stolen content).

UI & Design – Must look clean and have a thoughtful design.

Fun Factor – The project should have some unique, enjoyable element.

No Copyright Issues – No copyrighted assets, music, or images.

Optional Bonus – Explain your project in the form. A short pitch/summary can earn you extra points and increase your chances of being featured.
